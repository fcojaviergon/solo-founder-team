# CLAUDE.md — [PROJECT_NAME]

## Project
[PROJECT_NAME] — [One-line description]
Stack: [e.g.: Next.js 15 + Supabase + Tailwind + Vercel]
Solo founder: optimize for shipping speed with minimum viable quality.

## Principles
- Ship small, ship often. PRs < 300 lines.
- Tests for critical business logic. No 100% coverage.
- Conventional commits always (feat/fix/chore/docs/refactor).
- If something can fail in production, it needs error handling.
- Every Claude mistake becomes a rule below.

## Architecture
See docs/architecture.md for full decisions.
- [TODO: architectural pattern]
- [TODO: main layers]

## Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode
- Names in English, comments in English when they add value
- Components: PascalCase. Hooks: use + camelCase
- Files: kebab-case.tsx

## Tools
- **Linter/Formatter**: Biome (DO NOT use Prettier or ESLint)
- **Run lint**: `npx @biomejs/biome check --write ./src`
- **Build**: `npm run build`
- **Tests**: `npm run test`
- **Type check**: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Project Skills
This project has custom skills that define specific conventions:
- Frontend: .claude/skills/[YOUR-FRONTEND-SKILL]/SKILL.md
- Backend: .claude/skills/[YOUR-BACKEND-SKILL]/SKILL.md
Always consult these skills before implementing new code.

## Workflow
Spec (only if complex) → Plan → Implement → Test → Review → Ship
Global skills available at ~/.claude/skills/ for each phase.
Use /write-spec only for features with 10+ files or integrations.
Use subagents for heavy tasks that pollute context.

## Current Context
Active plan: docs/active-plan.md
Specs: specs/ (complex features only)

## Learned Rules
<!-- Add rules here every time Claude makes a repeated mistake -->
<!-- Example: "Don't use fetch directly, always use the api.ts wrapper" -->
