# CLAUDE.md — [PROJECT_NAME]

## Project
[PROJECT_NAME] — [Brief description of what this project does]
Stack: [e.g.: Next.js 15 + Supabase + Tailwind + Vercel]

## Principles
- Ship small, ship often. PRs < 300 lines.
- Tests for critical business logic only. No 100% coverage mandate.
- Conventional commits: feat/ fix/ chore/ docs/ refactor/.
- Production-facing code needs error handling.
- Every repeated Claude mistake becomes a rule in Learned Rules.

## Architecture
[Describe your architectural pattern: monolith, modular monolith, microservices, etc.]
[Main layers: API routes, services, repositories, components, etc.]
See docs/architecture.md for detailed decisions.

## Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode
- English names. Comments only when they add value.
- Components: PascalCase. Hooks: use + camelCase.
- Files: kebab-case.tsx

## Commands
- Lint: `npx @biomejs/biome check --write ./src`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test`
- Type check: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Dev: `npm run dev`

## Project Skills
Custom per-project conventions in .claude/skills/:
- Frontend: .claude/skills/frontend/SKILL.md
- Backend: .claude/skills/backend/SKILL.md

## Workflow
Spec (complex only) -> Plan -> Implement -> Test -> Review -> Ship
- /write-spec — only for features touching 10+ files or with integrations
- /plan-feature — generates user stories with acceptance criteria
- /implement — executes next pending story
- /test-verify — runs tests, build, lint in isolation
- /review-code — code review for bugs, security, simplicity
- /commit-ship — commit + PR

## Current Context
- Active plan: docs/active-plan.md
- Specs: specs/
- Decisions: docs/decisions/

## Learned Rules
<!-- Claude adds rules here when it makes a mistake that should not repeat -->
